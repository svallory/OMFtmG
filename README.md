# 👋 Welcome! 

This repository was created to try to put an end to the madness of writing Text Mate Language files (BY HAND) just so you can give your beautiful language some nice colors. They are many and go by many names: `tmLanguage`, `tmGrammar` and there's even the rare (and possibly even more dangerous `tmTheme`). See?! The many names this eval language/grammar/syntax/whatever goes by is a strategy to make your Google searches harder! Another piece in its evil scheme to make your life miserable and drive you insane.

﹣ How come I'm taking 7x the time it took to write my compiler just to write a single file?
      - You wonder in despair!
